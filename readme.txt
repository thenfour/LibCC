TODO:
x make blob tests.
x string conversion shit
x debug log
	x support disabling efficiently
	x support unicode log files
- test EVERY function... i know they don't even all build correctly.
	- string
	- blob
	- format
	- result
	- pathmatchspec



- Make Format work on other platforms, handle win32 shit correctly. don't depend on winapi.h
- Deal with string conversions correctly (big annoying gross task that will never get done)
- Possibly make it more modular so you don't need to port around so many header files
